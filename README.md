ABSTRACT <br> <br> <br>
Brain tumors are life-threatening, particularly gliomas, which are familiar forms
of brain tumors, that cause brain hemorrhage resulting in death. MRI scans, which
are the most reliable tools in detecting and staging the cancers, however, have
intrinsic variation resulting in difficulty in diagnosis. Computational tools are
needed to accurately identify the brain cancer sub-regions. We came up with a
novel architecture called V-Net Transformer which used the advantages of the
V-Net encoder-decoder-skip connections and the transformers to perform cancer
sub-region identification, particularly, whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing
tumor segmentation. Experimental evaluations show that the average dice coeffi-
cient score is 74.6 which is comparable with the existing architectures.
